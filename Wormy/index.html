		<h2>Wormy</h2>

		<p>
			A simple game based on the old game 'worm' (a.k.a. snake).
			I learned very interesting concepts during development of this game: The worm is a linked list of nodes.
			Each node in the linked list has a pointer to its next node except the head of the worm (which points to null).
			More interestingly, the only part of the worm that is actually moving its the worm's head!
			The rest of his body parts (nodes) move to the last position of their node next to them at the end of each game frame.
			The size of the canvas is intentionally kept small in order for the game to be playable on mobile/tablet devices.
			The worm can be moved either by using arrow keys (if you are on a computer) and/or by clicking/tapping anywhere on the
			screen (mobile/tablet devices). Each time you click on the screen, if where you click is on the left side of the worm,
			it moves to left, otherwise, the worm moves to right. Finally, the game keeps your highest score in a cookie
			so make sure your browser allows cookies if you want your high score to be recorded.
			<br />
			P.S. My highest score was 80. See if you can beat me.
